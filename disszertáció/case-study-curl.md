Developers use cURL to transfer information between two systems, generally in an “API” where a service needs to ask for or send data from another system. According to Stenberg, cURL is included in billions of smartphones, “several hundred million” TVs, and at least 100 million smart cars, every iPhone ever produced, and almost every other modern connected device and service you touch every day. The scale of its use is staggering considering that Stenberg does the lion’s share of the work maintaining it, with assistance from a community of volunteers. Yet few of the companies that rely on his code even realize it’s his code.

Stenberg, who lives near Stockholm, Sweden, invented cURL in 1998 and still maintains the project for free, though he did recently take a job at a company called wolfSSL, which now pays him to work on it “as full-time as possible.” Companies that rely on a specific piece of open-source software occasionally hire those projects’ creators to build upon the projects — in this case, wolfSSL has tasked Stenberg with not only maintaining cURL but building service contracts for providing personal support of cURL.

Stenberg believes that large companies should pay for support contracts from the developers of a library, which would compensate them for their time and help ensure a project is actually maintained for the long haul. With his work at wolfSSL, he hopes to convince companies like Apple to pay up in exchange for dedicated support, but the effort is still in an early stage.ZZ
