  abstract = {n this paper we report on the results of a study of the effort and motivations of individuals to contributing to the creation of Free/Open Source software. We used a Web-based survey, administered to 684 software developers in 287 F/OSS projects, to learn what lies behind the effort put into such projects. Academic theorizing on individual motivations for participating in F/OSS projects has posited that external motivational factors in the form of extrinsic benefits (e.g.: better jobs, career advancement) are the main drivers of effort. We find in contrast, that enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation, namely how creative a person feels when working on the project, is the strongest and most pervasive driver. We also find that user need, intellectual stimulation derived from writing code, and improving programming skills are top motivators for project participation. A majority of our respondents are skilled and experienced professionals working in IT-related jobs, with approximately 40 percent being paid to participate in the F/OSS project.},

The leading challenger to Microsoft's stranglehold on the computer industry is an operating system called Linux, the product of thousands of volunteer programmers who collaborate over the Internet. The software behind a majority of all the world's web sites doesn't come from a big company either, but from a loosely coordinated group of volunteer programmers called the Apache Group. The Internet itself, and much of its core software, was developed through a process of networked collaboration. The key to these stunning successes is a movement that has come to be called open source, because it depends on the ability of programmers to freely share their program source code so that others can improve it. In 1997, Eric S. Raymond outlined the core principles of this movement in a manifesto called "The Cathedral and the Bazaar," which was published and freely redistributed over the Internet.},

I contend that the open source software phenomenon has metamorphosed into a more mainstream and commercially viable form, which I label as OSS 2.0. I illustrate this transformation using a framework of process and product factors, and discuss the shift in the application of the bazaar metaphor from the development process to the product delivery and support process. Overall the OSS 2.0 phenomenon is significantly different from its free software antecedent. Its emergence accentuates the fundamental alteration of the basic ground-rules in the software landscape, signifying the end of the proprietary-driven model that has prevailed for the past 20 years or so. Thus, a clear understanding of the characteristics of the emergent OSS 2.0 phenomenon is required to address key challenges for research and practice.},

This study represents the ﬁrst attempt to propose and test a multi-level framework, examining the effects of ﬁve country-level variables and two under-explored ﬁrm-level factors on ﬁrm OSS adoption. The ﬁndings suggest that a country's uncertainty avoidance orientation has a positive impact on OSS adoption, whereas power distance orientation and economic development have a negative impact on OSS adoption. In addition, uncertainty avoidance at the country level sets boundaries for the effect of ﬁrm-level IT-based networks in a way that the impact of proprietary IT-based networks becomes stronger, but that of open IT-based networks becomes weaker when uncertainty avoidance is high rather than low. The study also develops public policy implications from these ﬁndings},

Individual web applications varied widely, with vulnerability densities ranging from 0 to 121.4 at the beginning of the study. While the total number of security problems decreased, vulnerability density increased in eight of the fourteen applications over the analysis period. We developed a security resources indicator metric, which we found to be strongly correlated ( = 0:67; p $<$ 0:05) with change in vulnerability density over time. Traditional software metrics, such as code size, cyclomatic complexity, nesting complexity, and churn, had signiﬁcant (p $<$ 0:05) but much smaller correlations ( = 0:31 at best) with vulnerability density. Vulnerability density was measured using the Fortify Source Code Analyzer static analysis tool.},

This article argues in three steps that cyber war has never happened in the past, that cyber war does not take place in the present, and that it is unlikely that cyber war will occur in the future. It ﬁrst outlines what would constitute cyber war: a potentially lethal, instrumental, and political act of force conducted through malicious code. The second part shows what cyber war is not, case-by-case. Not one single cyber offense on record constitutes an act of war on its own. The ﬁnal part offers a more nuanced terminology to come to terms with cyber attacks. All politically motivated cyber attacks are merely sophisticated versions of three activities that are as old as warfare itself: sabotage, espionage, and subversion.},

In order to begin investigating such claims, we examine data from two major open source projects, the Apache web server and the Mozilla browser. By using email archives of source code change history and problem reports we quantify aspects of developer participation, core team size, code ownership, productivity, defect density, and problem resolution intervals for these OSS projects. We develop several hypotheses by comparing the Apache project with several commercial projects. We then test and refine several of these hypotheses, based on an analysis of Mozilla data. We conclude with thoughts about the prospects for high-performance commercial/open source process hybrids.},

Metaphors have a valuable role in explaining to users what OSS is, and what their role involves. The dominant metaphors are the Cathedral and the Bazaar, proposed by Raymond. These metaphors have been valuable in identifying two approaches to software development. The metaphors also generate confusion, in part because of widely differing interpretations. A more structural reason for confusion is the use of vehicles which are not assigned to the same domain in the two metaphors. The negative consequences of this regarding comparison of approaches to software development are described. Adapted metaphors are proposed which facilitate comparison: the process which constitutes and maintains a Bazaar as an institution, and the process which constitutes and maintains a Shopping Mall.},

welfare compared to all-CS industries by letting firms share costs and avoid
duplication. However, code sharing also establishes a de facto quality-cartel that suppresses OS firms’ incentives to invest. Competition from CS firms weakens this cartel and improves welfare. That said, market forces alone provide too little CS competition. We find no support for various government
interventions based on tax breaks for OS-based firms and pro-OS procurement preferences by government. However, policies that directly target the supply of OS code have a positive impact.},

  abstract = {The open-source software movement is gaining increasing momentum in China. Of the limited numbers of open-source software in China, Red Flag Linux stands out most strikingly, commanding 30 percent share of the Chinese software market. Unlike the spontaneity of open-source movement in North America, open-source software development in China, such as Red Flag Linux, is an orchestrated activity wherein different levels of China's government play a vital role in sponsoring, incubating, and using open-source software, most conspicuously, Red Flag Linux. While there are no reports on open-source course management system in China, there are reports on the study and use of Western open-source course management systems for instruction and learning in Chinese higher education institutions. This paper discusses the current status of open-source software in China, including open-source course management software and associated tools and resources. Importantly, it describes the development model of Red Flag Linux, the most successful open-source software initiative in China. In addition, it explores the possibility of Chinese higher education institutions joining efforts to develop China’s own open-source course management system using the open-source development model established in North America. A timeline of current and major open-source projects of significance in China is provided. The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential for applying the open-source software development model to open and distance education in China.},

A VCS enables versioning, distributed collaboration and several other features, and is an important context for authorization and access control. Our main consideration behind the design of gitolite is the balance between expressive power, correctness and usability in realistic settings. We discuss our design of gitolite, and in particular the four user-classes in its delegation model, and the administrative actions a user at each class performs. We discuss also our ongoing work on expressing gitolite precisely in first-order logic, to thereby give it a precise semantics and establish correctness properties. gitolite has been adopted in open-source software development, university and industry settings. We discuss our experience with these deployments, and present some performance results related to access enforcement from a real deployment.},

  title = {A {{Primitive}} for {{Revealing Stealthy Peripheral}}-{{Based Attacks}} on the {{Computing Platform}}’s {{Main Memory}}},
  abstract = {Computer platform peripherals such as network and man-
agement controller can be used to attack the host computer via direct
memory access (DMA). DMA-based attacks launched from peripherals
are capable of compromising the host without exploiting vulnerabilities
present in the operating system running on the host. Therefore they
present a highly critical threat to system security and integrity. Un-
fortunately, to date no OS implements security mechanisms that can
detect DMA-based attacks. Furthermore, attacks against memory man-
agement units have been demonstrated in the past and therefore cannot
be considered trustworthy. We are the first to present a novel method for
detecting and preventing DMA-based attacks. Our method is based on
modeling the expected memory bus activity and comparing it with the
actual activity. We implement BARM, a runtime monitor that perma-
nently monitors bus activity to expose malicious memory access carried
out by peripherals. Our evaluation reveals that BARM not only detects
and prevents DMA-based attacks but also runs without significant over-
head due to the use of commonly available CPU features of the x86
platform.},

  abstract = {Ez a cikk áttekintő, problémaelemző célokat szolgál egy olyan kutatási munka
kezdeti szakaszában, amely a kritikus infrastruktúra egy speciális részterületének
feltárását tűzi ki célul. Elemzésre kerülnek a kritikus infrastruktúra védelem
fejlesztése szempontjából lényeges témakörök. Az aktuális kihívások és kockázatok
környezetében nem lehetünk elégedettek a megelőzés/védekezés jelen helyzetével.
Az áttekintett szempontok (fenyegetettség, stratégiák, definíciók, azonosítás,
tulajdonviszonyok, adatbázisok, jogalkotás, szervezeti kérdések, finanszírozás)
egyike alapján sem megnyugtató a helyzet. A rendkívül szerteágazó, szövevényes,
sokszor rajtunk kívülálló eseményektől is függő feladatsor miatt aligha várhatóak
gyors és mindenre kiterjedő megoldások. A védekezési mechanizmus kiépülését
egy-egy váratlan, nem kívánatos esemény jelentősen felgyorsíthatja. A döntés-
előkészítés sokszereplős, részérdekektől erősen tagolt mind belföldi, mind
nemzetközi vonatkozásban. A kutatási terület nyitott, az előrelépés szükségszerű, a
megoldás az érintett nemzetközi, állami szereplők, a tulajdonosi-üzemeltetői körök
és a szakirányú kutatók kezében van.},

system to determine whether its security is increasing

has been introduced and the rate at which vulnerabili-

versions.
We learn that 61\% of the lines of code in today’s
OpenBSD are foundational: they were introduced prior
to the release of the initial version we studied and have
not been altered since. We also learn that 62\% of re-
ported vulnerabilities were present when the study began
and can also be considered to be foundational.
We find strong statistical evidence of a decrease in the
rate at which foundational vulnerabilities are being re-
ported. However, this decrease is anything but brisk:
foundational vulnerabilities have a median lifetime of at
least 2.6 years.
Finally, we examined the density of vulnerabilities in
the code that was altered/introduced in each version. The
densities ranged from 0 to 0.033 vulnerabilities reported
per thousand lines of code. These densities will increase
as more vulnerabilities are reported.},

When the program is written from scratch, the first phase of development is characterized by a fast decline of the number of bugs, followed by a slow phase where most bugs have been fixed, hence, are hard to find. Releasing immediately bug fixes speeds up the debugging process, which substantiates bazaar open-source methodology. We provide a mathematical analysis that supports our numerical simulations. Finally, we apply our model to Linux history and determine the existence of a lower bound to the quality of its programmers.},

  abstract = {Managing Risk and Information Security: Protect to Enable, an ApressOpen title, describes the changing risk environment and why a fresh approach to information security is needed. Because almost every aspect of an enterprise is now dependent on technology, the focus of IT security must shift from locking down assets to enabling the business while managing and surviving risk. This compact book discusses business risk from a broader perspective, including privacy and regulatory considerations. It describes the increasing number of threats and vulnerabilities, but also offers strategies for developing solutions. These include discussions of how enterprises can take advantage of new and emerging technologies - such as social media and the huge proliferation of Internet-enabled devices - while minimizing risk. With ApressOpen, content is freely available through multiple online distribution channels and electronic formats with the goal of disseminating professionally edited and technically reviewed content to the worldwide community. Here are some of the responses from reviewers of this exceptional work: "Managing Risk and Information Security is a perceptive, balanced, and often thought-provoking exploration of evolving information risk and security challenges within a business context.? Harkins clearly connects the needed, but often-overlooked linkage and dialog between the business and technical worlds and offers actionable strategies.?? The book contains eye-opening security insights that are easily understood, even by the curious layman." Fred Wettling, Bechtel Fellow, IS\&T Ethics \& Compliance Officer, Bechtel ? ? "As disruptive technology innovations and escalating cyber threats continue to create enormous information security challenges, Managing Risk and Information Security: Protect to Enable provides a much-needed perspective. This book compels information security professionals to think differently about concepts of risk management in order to be more effective. The specific and practical guidance offers a fast-track formula for developing information security strategies which are lock-step with business priorities." Laura Robinson, Principal, Robinson Insight Chair, Security for Business Innovation Council (SBIC) Program Director, Executive Security Action Forum (ESAF) "The mandate of the information security function is being completely rewritten. Unfortunately most heads of security haven't picked up on the change, impeding their companies' agility and ability to innovate. This book makes the case for why security needs to change, and shows how to get started. It will be regarded as marking the turning point in information security for years to come." Dr. Jeremy Bergsman, Practice Manager, CEB ? ? "The world we are responsible to protect is changing dramatically and at an accelerating pace. Technology is pervasive in virtually every aspect of our lives. Clouds, virtualization and mobile are redefining computing - and they are just the beginning of what is to come. Your security perimeter is defined by wherever your information and people happen to be. We are attacked by professional adversaries who are better funded than we will ever be. We in the information security profession must change as dramatically as the environment we protect. We need new skills and new strategies to do our jobs effectively. We literally need to change the way we think. ? Written by one of the best in the business, Managing Risk and Information Security challenges traditional security theory with clear examples of the need for change. It also provides expert advice on how to dramatically increase the success of your security strategy and methods - from dealing with the misperception of risk to how to become a Z-shaped CISO. ? Managing Risk and Information Security is the ultimate treatise on how to deliver effective security to the world we live in for the next 10 years. It is absolute must reading for anyone in our profession - and should be on the desk of every CISO in the world." ? Dave Cullinane, CISSP CEO Security Starfish, LLC "In this overview, Malcolm Harkins delivers an insightful survey of the trends, threats, and tactics shaping information risk and security. From regulatory compliance to psychology to the changing threat context, this work provides a compelling introduction to an important topic and trains helpful attention on the effects of changing technology and management practices." Dr. Mariano-Florentino Cuľlar Professor, Stanford Law School Co-Director, Stanford Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC), Stanford University ? ? "Malcolm Harkins gets it. In his new book Malcolm outlines the major forces changing the information security risk landscape from a big picture perspective, and then goes on to offer effective methods of managing that risk from a practitioner's viewpoint. The combination makes this book unique and a must read for anyone interested in IT risk." Dennis Devlin AVP, Information Security and Compliance, The George Washington University ?? "Managing Risk and Information Security is the first-to-read, must-read book on information security for C-Suite executives.? It is accessible, understandable and actionable. No sky-is-falling scare tactics, no techno-babble - just straight talk about a critically important subject. There is no better primer on the economics, ergonomics and psycho-behaviourals of security than this." Thornton May, Futurist, Executive Director \& Dean, IT Leadership Academy ? ? "Managing Risk and Information Security is a wake-up call for information security executives and a ray of light for business leaders.? It equips organizations with the knowledge required to transform their security programs from a "culture of no" to one focused on agility, value and competitiveness. Unlike other publications, Malcolm provides clear and immediately applicable solutions to optimally balance the frequently opposing needs of risk reduction and business growth. This book should be required reading for anyone currently serving in, or seeking to achieve, the role of Chief Information Security Officer." Jamil Farshchi, Senior Business Leader of Strategic Planning and Initiatives, VISA?? ? "For too many years, business and security - either real or imagined - were at odds. In Managing Risk and Information Security: Protect to Enable, you get what you expect - real life practical ways to break logjams, have security actually enable business, and marries security architecture and business architecture. Why this book? ?It's written by a practitioner, and not just any practitioner, one of the leading minds in Security today." John Stewart, Chief Security Officer, Cisco ? ? "This book is an invaluable guide to help security professionals address risk in new ways in this alarmingly fast changing environment. Packed with examples which makes it a pleasure to read, the book captures practical ways a forward thinking CISO can turn information security into a competitive advantage for their business.? ? This book provides a new framework for managing risk in an entertaining and thought provoking way.

  abstract = {Industry involvement in open source software development has become a popular practice among companies which, e.g., share software development costs with other community participants or implement an open source based business model. An increased understanding of the underlying development structure, especially in a case where the community participants are composed of competing industry members, can be viewed as an important component of a company’ s business strategy planning and management. One way to understand the social structure of an open source community is by applying network analysis to its source code repositories. This case study shows how a large, company sponsored, and industry backed open source project, i.e. an open source project with the majority of the community members affiliated with the industry, is structured. In particular, it shows that the involvement of an entire industry eco system within a company sponsored open source project does not imply more equal distribution of the participating community members’ influences in terms of committers’ social networks. This setup of an open source community by itself does not imply any particular, either positive or negative, connotations. Consequently, the results of the study should be interpreted on a case basis, within a context of a company’ s strategy to participate or base products around a company sponsored open source product.},

  abstract = {This [full factroy chain from sand to computer] is, of course, 
quite impractical. Therefore, we need the second best thing, and that second best is a paradigm shift: replace trust with violence.

What we do is that binary packages are signed. The package installer verifies the signature before installing it, and rejects packages which do not come from "trusted sources". The same concept applies to Java applets, which can be granted extra permissions (and, indeed, permission to do whatever they want with your computer) provided that they are signed. Note that this is indeed a signature, not just an authentication; it is not sufficient (nor indeed necessary) that the package was downloaded from a "trusted repository" through HTTPS. Such a download would give you quite some guarantee that the package comes from whom you believe, and has not been modified in transit. But you want more: you want a proof. You want a signature because IF the package turns out to be clock-full of malware, THEN you can use the signature to demonstrate that the package provider was an accomplice, at least "by negligence". From signatures comes responsibility, and responsibility works on fear. Fear of litigation from abused customers. Fear of retaliation from law enforcement agencies. Ultimately, fear of violence.},

  abstract = {A large amount of intellectual effort is expend-
ed every day in the play of on-line games. It would be ex-
tremely valuable if one could create a system to harness
this intellectual effort for practical purposes. In this pa-
per, we discuss a new crowd-sourced, on-line game, called
Ghost Map that presents players with arcade-style puz-
zles to solve. The puzzles in Ghost Map are generated
from a formal analysis of the correctness of a software
program. In our approach, a puzzle is generated for each
potential flaw in the software and the crowd can produce
a formal proof of the software’s correctness by solving all
the corresponding puzzles. Creating a crowd-sourced
game entails many challenges, and we introduce some of
the lessons we learned in designing and deploying our
game, with an emphasis on the challenges in producing
real-time client gameplay that interacts with a server-
based verification engine. Finally, we discuss our planned
next steps, including extending Ghost Map’s ability to
handle more complex software and improving the game
mechanics to enable players to bring additional skills and
intuitions to bear on those more complex problems.},

  abstract = {In general it is assumed that a software product evolves
within the authoring company or group of developers that develop the
project. However, in some cases different groups of developers make the software evolve in different directions, a situation which is commonly known as a fork. In the case of free software, although forking is a practice
that is considered as a last resort, it is inherent to the four freedoms.
This paper tries to shed some light on the practice of forking. Therefore,
we have identified significant forks, several hundreds in total, and have
studied them in depth. Among the issues that have been analyzed for
each fork is the date when the forking occurred, the reason of the fork, and the outcome of the fork, i.e., if the original or the forking project are still developed. Our investigation shows, among other results, that forksoccur in every software domain, that they have become more frequent in recent years, and that very few forks merge with the original project.},

  title = {Overview of Critical Information Infrastructure Protection},
  isbn = {978-3-642-28919-4},
  abstract = {The present volume aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of the so-called Critical Infrastructure (CI), and particularly the Critical Information Infrastructure (CII), which not only forms one of the constituent sectors of the overall CI, but also is unique in providing an element of interconnection between sectors as well as often also intra-sectoral control mechanisms.

One problem faced by research on C(I)I is the extreme range of scales at which security problems may arise. This is true for the time dimension where policy-level decisions such as the deployment of physical infrastructure like roads and high-tension transmission lines have impacts measured in decades whilst industrial control systems must provide guaranteed and secure real-time responses in the millisecond range. It is, moreover, also the case for the physical extent of infrastructures where single physical facilities such as vaccine plants may be a vital element of national or supra-national infrastructures, but where the trans-national electrical power or natural gas transmission networks span entire continents.

The book hence surveys not only key high-level concepts and selected technical research areas with an emphasis on control systems as a highly active research area, but also seeks to include policy aspects as well as a discussion on models for validation and verification. This is rounded off by several studies of specific issues and challenges faced by individual CI sectors including the telecommunications, electricity, transportation, and financial services sectors.},

  abstract = {The aim of this article is to explore the differences and commonalities between open source software and other cases of open technology. The concept of open technology is used here to indicate various models of innovation based on the participation of a wide range of different actors who freely share the innovations they have produced. The article begins with a review of the problems connected to the production of public goods and explains why open source software seems to be a "curious exception" for traditional economic reasoning. Then it describes the successful operation of similar models of innovation open technology in other technological fields. The third section investigates the literature in relation to three fundamental issues in the current open source research agenda, namely, developers' motivations, performance, and sustainability of the model. Finally, the fourth section provides a final comparison between open source software and the other cases of open technology.},

Different approaches for introducing usability activities into open source software (OSS) development have not yet been fully evaluated. This paper experiments with the introduction of usability activities into OSS development through a participative approach. An empirical case study was carried out in a game development OSS project. The results of this study suggest that it is beneficial to introduce usability activities into OSS development through the participative approach. In the participative approach the usability experts become recognized part of the development community through adapting their ways of work into the culture of the OSS project and submitting code patches. This participative approach had a clear impact in the case project as seen in changes in the user interface and in improved usability. The challenge of adapting usability and OSS development philosophies and practices should, however, be researched further.},

  abstract = {Researchers are currently drawn to study projects hosted on GitHub due to its popularity, ease of obtaining data, and its distinctive built-in social features. GitHub has been found to create a transparent development environment, which together with a pull request-based workflow, provides a lightweight mechanism for committing, reviewing and managing code changes. These features impact how GitHub is used and the benefits it provides to teams' development and collaboration. While most of the evidence we have is from GitHub's use in open source software (oss) projects, GitHub is also used in an increasing number of commercial projects. It is unknown how GitHub supports these projects given that GitHub's workflow model does not intuitively fit the commercial development way of working. In this paper, we report findings from an online survey and interviews with GitHub users on how GitHub is used for collaboration in commercial projects. We found that many commercial projects adopted practices that are more typical of oss projects including reduced communication, more independent work, and self-organization. We discuss how GitHub's transparency and popular workflow can promote open collaboration, allowing organizations to increase code reuse and promote knowledge sharing across their teams.},

But what are the underlying principles allowing online creative collaboration to succeed, and how well do they transfer from one domain to another? In this paper, we address these questions by comparing and contrasting online, collaborative animated movies, called collabs, with OSS projects. First, we use qualitative methods to solicit potential success factors from collab participants. Then, we test these predictions by quantitatively analyzing a data set of nearly 900 collabs. Finally, we compare and contrast our results with the literature on OSS development and propose broader theoretical implications. Our findings offer a starting point for a systematic research agenda seeking to unlock the potential of online creative collaboration.},

We find that IBM Jazz successfully receives user feedback through this channel. We then explore the differences in work item processing in IBM Jazz between team members, project members and externals. We conclude that making public issue trackers available in closed source projects is a useful approach for eliciting feedback from the community, but that work items created by team members are processed differently from work items created by project members and externals.},

Given the difficulty in managing resources in closed source projects, planning and delivery for OSS projects will be an even bigger challenge. In this position paper, we describe the need for new effort estimation models for the development of OSS projects and how this will be required for future project management activities. We outline some of the guidelines to build these cost estimation models and some issues that arise in the verification and validation of these cost models.},

We harness three powerful forces to ride the waves of change: open-source software, commodity hardware, and web-like, representational state transfer architectures. This paper describes an early experiment in applying raging incrementalism to a complex system: large-scale digital video capture, distribution, and archival for launch range operations. We outline the methodology of raging incrementalism, describe the vital role open-source plays in system development and construction, and offer insights on the programmatic consequences of embracing open-source software.},

Software quality is an important characteristic effecting overall system lifecycle cost, performance and useful life. The existing models for software quality are based on empirical analysis of propriety source software (PSS), and need to be verified in OSS. Research on PSS has revealed that software quality declines, as it ages. Part of this decline is associated with the lifecycle maintenance activities that introduce change in the size and complexity of the system, while introducing software errors into modified system. Lifecycle maintenance activities in OSS systems are processed under a very different paradigm. We are interested in investigating the effects of maintenance activities on OSS project outcomes. Linux is one of the most popular and complex OSS project available. In our research, we investigate the characteristics of Linux source code. In this position paper we present some preliminary results of the effects of various types of maintenance activities on quality of Linux software.},

  abstract = {Background: People contribute to OSS projects in wildly different degrees, from reporting a single defect once and never coming back to spending many hours each workday on the project over several years - or anything in between. It is a common conception that these degrees of participation sort the participants into a number of similar groups which are layered like the peels of an onion: The onion model. Objective: We check whether this model of gradually different degrees of participation is valid with respect to the participation in OSS project mailing-list traffic. Methods: We perform social network analysis based on replies to mailing-list messages and use visualization to check the nature of three different groups of participants. Results: There appears to be a discontinuity with respect to core members: The degree to which very active core members (as opposed to less active co-developers) react to e-mails of senders from the project's periphery is significantly higher than would be expected from their level of activity in general. Limitations: The effect might be an artifact of the assumption that each mailing-list message can be treated the same. Conclusions: We conclude that core member status may be qualitatively (rather than just quantitatively) different and the transition of individual mailing-list participants towards ever higher participation is qualitatively discontinuous.},

  abstract = {Commercial software project managers design project organizational structure carefully, mindful of available skills, division of labour, geographical boundaries, etc. These organizational "cathedrals" are to be contrasted with the "bazaar-like" nature of Open Source Software (OSS) Projects, which have no pre-designed organizational structure. Any structure that exists is dynamic, self-organizing, latent, and usually not explicitly stated. Still, in large, complex, successful, OSS projects, we do expect that subcommunities will form spontaneously within the developer teams. Studying these subcommunities, and their behavior can shed light on how successful OSS projects self-organize. This phenomenon could well hold important lessons for how commercial software teams might be organized. Building on known well-established techniques for detecting community structure in complex networks, we extract and study latent subcommunities from the email social network of several projects: Apache HTTPD, Python, PostgresSQL, Perl, and Apache ANT. We then validate them with software development activity history. Our results show that subcommunities do indeed spontaneously arise within these projects as the projects evolve. These subcommunities manifest most strongly in technical discussions, and are significantly connected with collaboration behaviour.},

  abstract = {Software errors are a major cause for system failures. To effectively design tools and support for detecting and recovering from software failures requires a deep understanding of bug characteristics. Recently, software and its development process have significantly changed in many ways, including more help from bug detection tools, shift towards multi-threading architecture, the open-source development paradigm and increasing concerns about security and user-friendly interface. Therefore, results from previous studies may not be applicable to present software. Furthermore, many new aspects such as security, concurrency and open-source-related characteristics have not well studied. Additionally, previous studies were based on a small number of bugs, which may lead to non-representative results.To investigate the impacts of the new factors on software errors, we analyze bug characteristics by first sampling hundreds of real world bugs in two large, representative open-source projects. To validate the representativeness of our results, we use natural language text classification techniques and automatically analyze around 29, 000 bugs from the Bugzilla databases of the software.Our study has discovered several new interesting characteristics: (1) memory-related bugs have decreased because quite a few effective detection tools became available recently; (2) surprisingly, some simple memory-related bugs such as NULL pointer dereferences that should have been detected by existing tools in development are still a major component, which indicates that the tools have not been used with their full capacity; (3) semantic bugs are the dominant root causes, as they are application specific and difficult to fix, which suggests that more efforts should be put into detecting and fixing them; (4) security bugs are increasing, and the majority of them cause severe impacts.},

  abstract = {IT system development, integration, deployment, and administration benefit significantly from free and open source software (FOSS) tools and services. Affordability has been a compelling reason for adopting FOSS in computing curricula and equipping computing labs with support infrastructure. Using FOSS systems and services, however, is just the first step in taking advantage of how FOSS development principles and practices can impact student learning in IT degree programs. Above all, FOSS development of IT systems requires changes to how students, instructors, and other contributors work collaboratively and openly and get involved and invested in project activities. In this paper I examine the challenges to engage students in FOSS development projects proposed by real clients. A six-week course project revealed problems with adopting FOSS development and collaboration across different activities and roles that student team members have assumed. Despite these problems, students have showed a genuine and strong interest in gaining more practice with FOSS development. FOSS development teaching was further refined in two other courses to learn about adequate teaching strategies and the competencies that students achieve when they participate in FOSS development of IT systems.},

Survey data collected from 118 OSS developers on Sourceforge.net was used to test the research model. The results indicate that leaders' transformational leadership is positively related to developers' intrinsic motivation and leaders' active management by exception, a form of transactional leadership, is positively related to developers' extrinsic motivation.},

Relatively few were requested directly by users. Validation and documentation took the form of informal discussions via the project's developer mailing list. These results are consistent with an earlier study of the Firefox web browser, suggesting that there is a common open source requirements approach that is independent of project size.},

When man and machine interact, co-exist, and intermingle, cyberspace comes to interpenetrate the real world fully. In this cyborg world, software retains its regulatory role, becoming a language of interaction with our extended cyborg selves. The mediation of our extended selves by closed software threatens individual autonomy. We define a notion of freedom for software that does justice to our conception of it as language, sketching the outlines of a social and political philosophy for a cyborg world. In a cyberspace underwritten by free software, political structures become contingent and flexible: the polity can choose to change the extent and character of its participation. The rejection of opaque power is an old anarchist ideal: free software, by making power transparent, carries the potential to place substantive restrictions on the regulatory power of cyborg government.},

  abstract = {Research into traditional software evolution has been tackled from two broad perspectives: that focused on the how, which looks at the processes, methods and techniques to implement and evolve software; and that focused on the what/why perspective, aiming at achieving an understanding of the drivers and general characteristics of the software evolution phenomenon. The two perspectives are related in various ways: the study of the what/why is for instance essential to achieve an appropriate management of software engineering activities, and to guide innovation in processes, methods and tools, that is, the how. The output of the what/why studies is exemplified by empirical hypotheses, such as the staged model of software evolution. This paper focuses on the commonalities and differences between the evolution and patterns in the lifecycles of traditional commercial systems and free/libre/open source software (FLOSS) systems. The existing staged model for software evolution is therefore revised for its applicability on FLOSS systems.},

The results show that in these cases the usability specialists embraced aspects of both philosophies; hence, these philosophies coexisted. However, the usability specialists either 'became them' or 'were close while kept the distance'. In both cases the usability specialists aligned their work with the OSS philosophy. However, through this alignment, in the other case they become very immersed in the OSS project, encountering a risk of becoming misaligned with the core HCI philosophy.

Building on the theoretical underpinnings of the Self-Determination Theory, we proposed and empirically assessed two conceptual models to examine OSS adopters' extent of adoption (based on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation) and OSS non-adopters' intentions for adoption (based on amotivation). Results from the survey collected from 264 OSS adopters and 212 OSS non-adopters reveal that strategy belief amotivation is the major factor for not using OSS (i.e., non-adopters) while identified regulation is the major extrinsic motivation affecting the extent of adoption (i.e., adopters). Interestingly, intrinsic motivation to accomplish and capacity beliefs amotivation do not significantly affect adoption extent and adoption intention respectively.

The business model, a powerful tool for extracting economic value from the potential of technological innovation, clearly plays an important role in the success of a business. In this paper we investigate the role of open source in the business models of Red Hat and IBM and describe how OSS has contributed to their success. A framework recently developed by some of the authors is used to evaluate and identify the key factors important to the integration of OSS strategies into traditional business models.},

  abstract = {Software plays a very important role in our aspiration as a country to use Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) as enablers for development. Licensing cost for Proprietary Software (PS) is however expensive and does not offer the freedom to manipulate the source code. Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) emerged as an alternative to Proprietary Software and has since its introduction made inroads onto desktops and servers alike. With FOSS emerged the freedom to run the programs for any purpose, freedom to study and modify the software, freedom to copy the software and share with neighbors and freedom to improve the program and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits. This paper makes a case for these freedoms. The paper first compares PS and FOSS use in Ghana and proposes a way for government to adopt FOSS. Findings of this case study are a result of field research conducted by the authors, personal interviews and through desk research.},

IT companies spend considerable resources in the training of their employees to succeed in a continuously changing industry. Depending on the voluntary commitment of their contributors, initiatives developing Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) identified members' learning and their retention as vital. Although contributors' knowledge building has been repeatedly found to facilitate their project continuance, FLOSS projects are lacking operational advices on how to assist their members' learning. Drawing on previous literature which emphasizes project members' social interactions and their practical experiences to build new knowledge, we propose mentoring as a training method for FLOSS projects. Based on organizational experiences, we propose a measure to evaluate mentoring as an appropriate strategy for FLOSS initiatives to facilitate individuals' learning and to retain their contributors on longitudinal base.},

  abstract = {Software peer review has proven to be a successful technique in open source software (OSS) development. In contrast to industry, where reviews are typically assigned to specific individuals, changes are broadcast to hundreds of potentially interested stakeholders. Despite concerns that reviews may be ignored, or that discussions will deadlock because too many uninformed stakeholders are involved, we find that this approach works well in practice. In this paper, we describe an empirical study to investigate the mechanisms and behaviours that developers use to find code changes they are competent to review. We also explore how stakeholders interact with one another during the review process. We manually examine hundreds of reviews across five high profile OSS projects. Our findings provide insights into the simple, community-wide techniques that developers use to effectively manage large quantities of reviews. The themes that emerge from our study are enriched and validated by interviewing long-serving core developers.},

We show that the fight against software piracy is most likely speeding up the adoption especially in the developing countries. The situation is somewhat different in those parts of the world, which have lower piracy rates. There, political lobbying seems to offer the major push for open source software. This brings us to study the actual open source software adoption in the Finland, which is both the home of Linux and also one of the most advances information societies with little piracy. The outcome is rather surprising - the Finnish government is currently ignoring open source. The results we have got from our a survey to all Finnish municipalities and from additional expanded interviews shows that there is currently high demand and growing interest for open source solutions within the Finnish municipalities but the government (by ignoring the issue) and the private sector (being mainly committed to proprietary solutions) are not able to fill the needs. We propose that the governments in the rich countries should in fact learn from developing countries and have a more proactive policy approach to open source software.},

We find that the impact on participation depends on how the acquiring company is perceived. The announcement of an acquisition by a company perceived as hostile had a negative effect on participation, whereas announcement of acquisition by a more friendly company was found to have no effect on participation. These changes in participation occurred without any accompanying change in the product itself, or its licensing. This work provides the evidence of the effect of external events on online participation.},

Development windows are decreasing; scale and complexity are increasing; business requirements are vague and changing; and the underlying technology moves ever on. Agile methods have emerged as leading contenders to tame these challenges. Small teams, face-to-face communication, an emphasis on simplicity and a selection of development best practices contribute to software development which is relevant, yet fast and flexible. At the same time, Open Source Software is increasingly providing infrastructure, tools and components to companies. Progressive development teams are beginning to work in more open, collaborative, and distributed ways. In some respects these practices are similar to agile practices, but in important ways, very different. Yet, both are important and offer unique benefits. This paper discusses the prospects of combining the two in the context of corporate software development, and the approach we suggest to do this.},

Using a three-stage manual and automated process, we analyzed 267,046 code review requests from 10 open source projects and identified 413 Vulnerable Code Changes (VCC). Some key results include: (1) code review can identify common types of vulnerabilities; (2) while more experienced contributors authored the majority of the VCCs, the less experienced contributors' changes were 1.8 to 24 times more likely to be vulnerable; (3) the likelihood of a vulnerability increases with the number of lines changed, and (4) modified files are more likely to contain vulnerabilities than new files. Knowing which code changes are more prone to contain vulnerabilities may allow a security expert to concentrate on a smaller subset of submitted code changes. Moreover, we recommend that projects should: (a) create or adapt secure coding guidelines, (b) create a dedicated security review team, (c) ensure detailed comments during review to help knowledge dissemination, and (d) encourage developers to make small, incremental changes rather than large changes.},

The examples described are drawn from the experience of managing tool development within the Sakai Project [1], a higher education effort to build and share a community source framework for supporting on-line collaboration in academic courses and projects. With a far-flung community of users and developers, this project requires new approaches to eliciting, analyzing, and prioritizing user needs. The issues outlined in this paper are currently being met by a preliminary set of solutions that makes use of web-based project management technologies. These technologies along with some planning and communication strategies help improve the decision-making process involved in deciding whether and how to choose among proposed constraints, use cases, and feature requests.},

This paper presents the results of a web-based survey that examined which factors affect participant satisfaction with FLOSS projects. A total of 183 usable responses were received from people in 33 countries, representing over 30 different LIM FLOSS projects. Stepwise hierarchical regression showed that five factors (perceived project openness, perceived developer communication quality, perceived complexity, extent of participation, and perceived product openness) accounted for 44\% of the variance in satisfaction. Community-oriented characteristics had the most influence, suggesting that in a FLOSS context, project participants need to focus on community development and support to increase overall satisfaction with the project.},

Concerning the security measurements, they are much more sophisticated in QualOSS than in OpenBRR. Where OpenBRR have only three security metrics, QualOSS has nine security indicator with altogether 30-40 security metrics.

First, a balanced scorecard initiative must embrace a multi-disciplinary, multi-stakeholder and community-oriented approach, taking into account the needs of diverse constituencies. Second, public sector e-Government leaders can benefit from the same robust perspective on learning, innovation, and customer satisfaction in addition to financial measures that the balanced scorecard has brought to private sector managers. This paper shares the experience of one commercial company (Microsoft Corporation) taking a balanced scorecard approach to open source policy and strategy development, and offers an analysis of implications and opportunities for e-Government leaders.},

In an effort to characterize and understand these differences we examine two Google-led projects, Android and Chromium OS, three Microsoft projects, Bing, Office, and MS SQL, and projects internal to AMD. We contrast our findings with data taken from traditional software inspection conducted on a Lucent project and from open source software peer review on six projects, including Apache, Linux, and KDE. Our measures of interest include the review interval, the number of developers involved in review, and proxy measures for the number of defects found during review. We find that despite differences among projects, many of the characteristics of the review process have independently converged to similar values which we think indicate general principles of code review practice. We also introduce a measure of the degree to which knowledge is shared during review. This is an aspect of review practice that has traditionally only had experiential support. Our knowledge sharing measure shows that conducting peer review increases the number of distinct files a developer knows about by 66\% to 150\% depending on the project. This paper is one of the first studies of contemporary review in software firms and the most diverse study of peer review to date.},

  abstract = {Open source software projects are characterized as self organizing and dynamic in which volunteers around the world primarily driven by self-motivation (and not necessarily monetary compensation) contribute and collaborate to a software product. In contrast to close source or proprietary software, the organizational structure and task allocation in an open source project setting is unstructured. Software project managers perform risk, threat and vulnerability analysis to gain insights into the organizational structure for de-risking or risk mitigation. For example, it is important for a project manager to have an understanding of critical employees, core team, subject matter experts, sub-groups, leaders and communication bridges. Software repositories such as defect tracking systems, versioning systems and mailing lists contains a wealth of valuable information that can be mined for solving practically useful software engineering tasks. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to mine defect tracking system for risk, threat and vulnerability analysis in a software project. We derive a collaboration network from a defect tracking system and apply social network analysis techniques to investigate the derived network for the purpose of risk and vulnerability analysis. We perform empirical analysis on bug report data of Mozilla Firefox project and present the results of our analysis. We demonstrate how important information pertaining to risk and vulnerability can be uncovered using network analysis techniques from static record keeping software archive such as the bug tracking system.},

We show that the change in number and density of issues reported by the source code analyzer is indicative of the change in rate of discovery of exploitable bugs for new releases --- formally we demonstrate a statistically significant correlation of moderate strength. The strength of the correlation is an artifact of other factors such as the degree of scrutiny: the number of security analysts investigating the software. This also demonstrates that static source code analysis can be used to make some assessment of risk even when constraints do not permit human review of the issues identified by the analysis. We find only a weak correlation between absolute values measured by the source code analyzer and rate of discovery of exploitable bugs, so in general it is unsafe to use absolute values of number of issues or issue densities to compare different applications or software. Our results demonstrate that software quality, as measured by the number of issues, issue density or number of exploitable bugs, does not always improve with each new release. However, generally the rate of discovery of exploitable bugs begins to drop three to five years after the initial release.},

  abstract = {Volatile software modules, for the purposes of this work, are defined as those that are significantly more change-prone than other modules in the same system or subsystem. There is significant literature investigating models for predicting which modules in a system will become volatile, and/or are defect-prone. Much of this work focuses on using source code-related characteristics (e.g., complexity metrics) and simple change metrics (e.g., number of past changes) as inputs to the predictive models. Our work attempts to broaden the array of factors considered in such prediction approaches. To this end, we collected data directly from development personnel about the factors they rely on to foresee what parts of a system are going to become volatile. In this paper, we describe a focus group study conducted with the development team of a small but active open source project, in which we asked this very question. The results of the focus group indicate, among other things, that a period of volatility in a particular area of the system is often predicted by a pattern characterized by inactivity in a certain area (resulting in that area becoming less mature than others), increased communication between developers regarding opportunities for improvement in that area, and then the emergence of a champion who takes the initiative to start working on those improvements. The initial changes lead to more changes (both to extend the improvements already made and to fix problems introduced), thus leading to volatility.},

  abstract = {Open source software (OSS) is increasingly becoming an alternative for proprietary software (PS), particularly in the government sector globally. The adoption and implementation of OSS by the government sector is cited as one of the enablers for the adoption of OSS by the private sector. It is also apparent that in the government sector internationally, OSS is seen as a viable technology for reasons such as lowering software costs, growing local software development industry, and bridging the digital divide. In South Africa (SA), an OSS policy that mandates OSS usage within ministries is in place. But according to various open source advocates, little has happened with regards to OSS implementation in the SA government. This paper reports on the current status of OSS usage within the SA government by surveying forty (40) national departments, targeting Information Technology (IT) directors and managers. The results indicate that OSS usage within the ministries is not yet extensive as required by the OSS policy. Various challenges and obstacles are hampering full OSS implementation within the ministries. The contribution of this research paper is an OSS expansion model, which is proposed as a possible solution to improve the current status of OSS usage within the SA government departments. The model proposed is in line with SA government's implementation strategy as outlined in the OSS policy.},

Various factors, such as changes in the legal landscape, commercial code licensed as FOSS, or code reused from other FOSS systems, lead to evolution of licensing, which may affect the way a system or part thereof can be subsequently used. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor licensing evolution. However, manually tracking the licensing evolution of thousands of files is a daunting task. After presenting several cases of the effects of licensing evolution, we propose an approach to automatically track changes occurring in the licensing terms of a system. Then, we report an empirical study of the licensing evolution of six different FOSS systems. Results show that licensing underwent frequent and substantial changes.},

We observed that these communities intensively use blogs with one new entry about every 8 hours. A blog entry includes 14 times more words than a commit message. When analyzing the content of the blogs, we found that most popular topics represent high-level concepts such as functional requirements and domain concepts. Source code related topics are covered in less than 15\% of the posts. Our results also show that developers are more likely to blog after corrective engineering and management activities than after forward engineering and re-engineering activities. Our findings call for a hypothesis-driven research to further understand the role of social media in software engineering and integrate it into development processes and tools.},

In order to understand how the the population of contributors evolve over time, we propose a methodology that adapts Lotka-Volterra-based biological models used for describing host-parasite interactions. Experiments based on data from the Github collaborative platform showed that the proposed approach performs effectively in terms of providing an estimation of the population of developers for each project over time.},

Typically, each project produces releases in its own way, using various methods of versioning, archiving, announcing and publishing the release. Understanding the release history of a software project can shed light on the project history, as well as the release process used by that project, and how those processes change. However, many factors make automating the retrieval of release history information difficult, such as the many sources of data, a lack of relevant standards and a disparity of tools used to create releases. In spite of the large amount of raw data available, no attempt has been made to create a release history database of a large number of projects in the open source ecosystem. This paper presents our experiences, including the tools, techniques and pitfalls, in our early work to create a software release history database which will be of use to future researchers who want to study and model the release engineering process in greater depth.},

Successful onboarding programs can result in increased performance in conventional organisations, but there is little guidance on how to onboard new developers in Open Source Software (OSS) projects. Goal: In this study, we examine how mentoring and project characteristics influence the effectiveness and efficiency of the onboarding process. We study a collaboration program involving a total of nine Open Source Software projects and more than 120 students from different universities around the world as part of Facebook's Education Modernization Program. Method: We use quantitative measurements of source code repositories, issue tracking systems, and discussion fora to examine how newcomers become contributing members of their OSS projects. Results: We found that developers receiving deliberate onboarding support through mentoring were more active at an earlier stage than developers entering projects through conventional means. Also, we found that project size and lifetime influenced onboarding. Conclusion: Empirical decision support can contribute to a more effective onboarding process in OSS projects. Mentor support in critical stages can accelerate the process, but project maturity is also a significant factor that increases the effect of onboarding.},

  abstract = {In this paper we introduce two project evolution indicators.
One is showing an increase of downloads of the project and therefore a
growing interest of users in the results of the project. The second indicator is predicting the future evolution of the project with the submission
of new revisions to the concurrent versioning system. Both indicators can provide evidence of the sustainability of a software project. We used the General Linear Model method to statistically formulate the two linear
equations that can be used to predict the two indicators. The predicting equations were build by using two stratified data samples one of 760 projects and the second of 880 projects extracted from the SourceForge repository. The six metrics included into the final version of the two
models were extracted from a set of thirty project and product metrics as: the number of downloads, the number of developers, etc. We have validated the discriminant and the concurrent validity of the two models by using different statistical tests as the goodness-of-fit and we have used the two models to predict the indicators on two hold-out validation samples. The model predicting the increment of downloads was correct in 75 percent of the cases, the model predicting the submission of new revisions was correct in 93 percent of the cases.},

Our research shows that error handling, redesign, and precondition validation are the most used methods in solving vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. This contribution is accompanied with statistics on the occurrence of the different types of vulnerabilities and their solutions that we observed during our case study, combined with example source code patches. We also combine our findings with existing programming guidelines to create the first security-oriented coding guidelines for the Linux kernel.},

  abstract = {The future Internet will embrace the intelligence of Web 3.0 and the omnipresence of every day connected objects. The later was envisioned as the Internet of Things. Security and interoperability concerns are hindering the service innovations using the Internet of Things. This paper addresses secure access provision to Internet of Things-enabled services and interoperability of security attributes between different administrative domains. In this paper we proposed a layered architecture of Internet of Things framework where a semantically enhanced overlay interlink the other layers and facilitate secure access provision to Internet of Things-enabled services. The main element of semantic overlay is security reasoning through ontologies and semantic rules. Finally the interoperability of security aspect is addressed through ontology and a machine-to-machine platform. This paper provides implementation details of security reasoning and the interoperability aspects and discusses crucial challenges in these areas.},

With the developments in the technology, Internet of Things (IoT) become important part of human life. However, it is not well defined and secure. Now, various security issues are considered as major problem for a full-fledged IoT environment. There exists a lot of security challenges with the proposed architectures and the technologies which make the backbone of the Internet of Things. Some efficient and promising security mechanisms have been developed to secure the IoT environment, however, there is a lot to do. The challenges are ever increasing and the solutions have to be ever improving. Therefore, aim of this paper is to discuss the history, background, statistics of IoT and security based analysis of IoT architecture. In addition, we will provide taxonomy of security challenges in IoT environment and taxonomy of various defense mechanisms. We conclude our paper discussing various research challenges that still exist in the literature, which provides better understanding of the problem, current solution space, and future research directions to defend IoT against different attacks.},

  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) security and privacy remain a major challenge, mainly due to the massive scale and distributed nature of IoT networks. Blockchain-based approaches provide decentralized security and privacy, yet they involve significant energy, delay, and computational overhead that is not suitable for most resource-constrained IoT devices. In our previous work, we presented a lightweight instantiation of a BC particularly geared for use in IoT by eliminating the Proof of Work (POW) and the concept of coins. Our approach was exemplified in a smart home setting and consists of three main tiers namely: cloud storage, overlay, and smart home. In this paper we delve deeper and outline the various core components and functions of the smart home tier. Each smart home is equipped with an always online, high resource device, known as “miner” that is responsible for handling all communication within and external to the home. The miner also preserves a private and secure BC, used for controlling and auditing communications. We show that our proposed BC-based smart home framework is secure by thoroughly analysing its security with respect to the fundamental security goals of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Finally, we present simulation results to highlight that the overheads (in terms of traffic, processing time and energy consumption) introduced by our approach are insignificant relative to its security and privacy gains.},

As the number of device connection is increased, it increases the Security risk. Security is the biggest issue for IoT at any companies across the globe. Furthermore, privacy and data sharing can again be considered as a security concern for IoT. Companies, those who use IoT technique, need to find a way to store, track, analyze and make sense of the large amounts of data that will be generated.

Operating in a body area network around a smartphone user they serve a variety of commercial, medical, and personal uses. Whether used for fitness tracking, mobile health monitoring, or as remote controllers, wearable devices can include sensors that collect a variety of data and actuators that provide hap tic feedback and unique user interfaces for controlling software and hardware. Wearables are typically wireless and use Bluetooth LE (low energy) to transmit data to a waiting smartphone app. Frequently, apps forward this data onward to online web servers for tracking. Security and privacy concerns abound when wearables capture sensitive data or provide critical functionality. This paper develops a platform, called SecuWear, for conducting wearable security research, collecting data, and identifying vulnerabilities in hardware and software. SecuWear combines open source technologies to enable researchers to rapidly prototype security vulnerability test cases, evaluate them on actual hardware, and analyze the results to understand how best to mitigate problems. The paper includes two types of evaluation in the form of a comparative analysis and empirical study. The results reveal how several passive observation attacks present themselves in wearable applications and how the SecuWear platform can capture the necessary information needed to identify and combat such attacks.},

Furthermore, research on IoT security requirements is insufficient now. Therefore, this paper focuses on IoT security, and its requirements. First, we propose basic security requirements of IoT by analyzing three basic characteristics (i.e., heterogeneity, resource constraint, dynamic environment). Then, we suggest six key elements of IoT (i.e., IoT network, cloud, user, attacker, service, platform) and analyze their security issues for overall security requirements.

  abstract = {Fog networking, an emerging concept in the context of cloud computing, is an idea to bring computation, communication and storage near to edge devices. Fog computing can offer low latency, geographically distributed mobile applications, and distributed control systems. On the other side, Software defined networking is a concept to make networking flexible and programmable. These two technologies together can create flexible and scalable networks to handle heterogeneous and massively increasing applications of IoT. In this paper we discuss how these two technologies can interplay with each other to be enabler of next generation IoT. We discuss that why these technologies are important for IoT and what current architectures are available to support IoT.},

  abstract = {Open Source Software (OSS) development is often characterized as a fundamentally new way to develop software. Past analyses and discussions, however, have treated OSS projects and their organization mostly as a static phenomenon. Consequently, we do not know how these communities of software developers are sustained and reproduced over time through the progressive integration of new members. To shed light on this issue I report on my analyses of socialization in a particular OSS community. In particular, I document the relationships OSS newcomers develop over time with both the social and material aspects of a project. To do so, I combine two mutually informing activities: ethnography and the use of software specially designed to visualize and explore the interacting networks of human and material resources incorporated in the email and code databases of OSS. Socialization in this community is analyzed from two perspectives: as an individual learning process and as a political process. From these analyses it appears that successful participants progressively construct identities as software craftsmen, and that this process is punctuated by specific rites of passage. Successful participants also understand the political nature of software development and progressively enroll a network of human and material allies to support their efforts. I conclude by discussing how these results could inform the design of software to support socialization in OSS projects, as well as practical implications for the future of these projects.},

  abstract = {A number of software reliability growth models have been reported in the literature for open source software (OSS) systems but the effect of up-gradations on the reliability growth of multi-releases of such software systems has been discussed by a few. In this paper, the discrete modeling framework has been proposed to study the reliability growth process of OSS systems with multiple releases. The proposed model is based upon the assumption that during up-gradation some new faults are introduced in the code in addition to the left over fault content of the previous version. To validate our model, we have chosen two successful open source projects-Mozilla and Apache for its multi release failure datasets. Graphs representing goodness of fit of the proposed model have been drawn. The parameter estimates and measures of goodness of fit criteria suggest that the proposed software reliability growth model for multi-release OSS fits the actual datasets very well. An optimal release policy has been formulated by taking into account the cost of fault removal during testing and operational phases and reliability targets pre-specified by the decision makers. In addition, numerical example along with the sensitivity analysis has been provided to illustrate optimal release policy.},

  abstract = {Software provided under open source licenses is widely used, from forming high-profile stand-alone applications (e.g., Mozilla Firefox) to being embedded in commercial offerings (e.g., network routers). Despite the high frequency of use of open source licenses, there has been little work about whether software developers understand the open source licenses that they use. To help understand whether or not developers understand the open source licenses they use, we conducted a survey that posed development scenarios involving three popular open source licenses (GNU GPL 3.0, GNU LGPL 3.0 and MPL 2.0) both alone and in combination. The 375 respondents to the survey, who were largely developers, gave answers consistent with those of a legal expert’s opinion in 62\% of 42 cases. Although developers clearly understood cases involving one license, they struggled when multiple licenses were involved. To understand the context in which licensing issues arise in practice, we analyzed real-world questions posed by developers about the three licenses considered in the survey on online question-and-answer communities. We also interviewed practicing developers about license interaction problems they have faced. Among several lessons, we learnt that licensing issues can constrain software evolution and that developers are cautious of more restrictive licenses. Our results indicate a need for tool support to help guide developers in understanding the structure of the code and the technical details of a project while taking into account the exact requirements imposed by the licenses involved.},

We introduce a technical lag metric for dependencies in package networks, in order to assess how outdated a software package is compared to the latest available releases of its dependencies. We empirically analyse the package update practices and technical lag for the npm distribution of JavaScript packages. Our results show a strong presence of technical lag caused by the specific use of dependency constraints, indicating a reluctance to update dependencies to avoid backward incompatible changes.},

It is particularly challenging in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) ecosystems, in which hundreds of loosely connected developers and their projects need to be coordinated to release software to a schedule. To better understand this process and its challenges, we analyzed over two and half years of communication in the GNOME ecosystem and studied developers’ interactions. We cataloged communication channels, categorized high level communication and coordination activities in one of them, and triangulated our results by interviewing developers. We found that a release schedule, influence instead of direct control, and diversity are factors that impact positively the release process in the GNOME ecosystem. Our results can help organizations build better large-scale teams and show that research focused on individual projects might miss important parts of the picture.},

  abstract = {At its core, free, libre, and open source software (FLOSS) is defined by its adherence to a set of licenses that give various freedoms to the users of the software, for example the ability to use the software, to read or modify its source code, and to distribute the software to others. In addition, many FLOSS projects and developers also champion other values related to “freedom” and “openness”, such as transparency, for example in communication and decision-making, or community-orientedness, for example in broadening access, collaboration, and participation. This paper explores how one increasingly common software development practice - communicating inside non-archived, third-party “walled gardens” - puts these FLOSS values into conflict. If communities choose to use non-archived walled gardens for communication, they may be prioritizing one type of openness (broad participation) over another (transparency). We use 18 FLOSS projects as a sample to describe how walled gardens are currently being used for intra-project communication, as well as to determine whether or not these projects provide archives of these communications. Findings will be useful to the FLOSS community as a whole as it seeks to understand the evolution and impact of its communication choices.},

  abstract = {A software ecosystem consists of a software platform, a set of internal and external developers and domain experts in service to a community of users that compose relevant solution elements to satisfy their needs. Open source is well-known for its potential to frame software ecosystems with its networking tendency and provision for further customization with access to software source code. Open source is increasingly becoming the choice for health information system implementations in low resource settings.This longitudinal case study was designed to study the research question, how a software ecosystem is being built around an open source health information system implementation. Empirically the study was positioned in a multi-sector initiative identifying and support nutritionally at-risk households to eliminating malnutrition. The discussion reveals how new dependencies between health and non-health sector actors were created with the emerging software ecosystem based on an open source framework and supplementary custom-built web and mobile components.},

We investigated publicly available factors (e. g., development activity such as commits, code size, or fraction of code size in different programming languages) to identify which one has the major impact on the security effort of using a FOSS component in a larger software product.},

  abstract = {Open Source Software is a term used to identify software developed and released under an “open source” license, meaning that under certain conditions; it is openly available for use, inspection, modification, and for redistribution free of cost (or with cost based on the license agreement). Incorporation of OSS while developing software can reduce time and cost of development. The nature of the work force (volunteers and paid) in OSS projects is transient and results in high turnover leading to knowledge loss. In this work, we explore the phenomenon of knowledge loss in OSS projects. Maintenance of OSS projects requires knowledge, typically shared asynchronously using technology-mediated channels. Knowledge sought in this manner is reactive in the sense that a developer will consult these channels looking for possible solutions or supporting information. We follow the backward snowballing to study the relevant literature on knowledge loss in OSS. Our work suggests that proactive knowledge exchange mechanisms may bring some benefits to OSS projects. Further integration of knowledge management practices with the established OSS practices can minimise knowledge loss.},

In our previous study, we have shown that license inconsistencies do exist in open source projects and may lead to potential license violation problems. In this study, we try to find out whether the issues of license inconsistencies are properly solved by analyzing two versions of a FOSS distribution—Debian—and investigate the evolution patterns of license inconsistencies. Findings are: license inconsistencies occur mostly because the original copyright owner updated the license while the reusers were still using the old version of the source files with the old license; most license inconsistencies would disappear when the reusers synchronize their project from the upstream, while some would exist permanently if reusers decide not to synchronize anymore. Legally suspicious cases have not been found yet in those Debian distributions.},

Companies must govern their FLOSS use to avoid potential risks to their intellectual property resulting from the use of FLOSS components. A particular challenge is license compliance. To manage the complexity of license compliance, companies should use tools and well-defined processes to perform these tasks time and cost efficiently. This paper investigates and presents common industry requirements for FLOSS governance tools, followed by an evaluation of the suggested requirements by matching them with the features of existing tools.We chose 10 industry leading companies through polar theoretical sampling and interviewed their FLOSS governance experts to derive a theory of industry needs and requirements for tooling. We then analyzed the features of a governance tools sample and used this analysis to evaluate two categories of our theory: FLOSS license scanning and FLOSS in product bills of materials. The result is a list of FLOSS governance requirements based on our qualitative study of the industry, evaluated using the existing governance tool features. For higher practical relevance, we cast our theory as a requirements specification for FLOSS governance tools.},

In this paper, we describe and categorize different types of license inconsistencies and propose a method to detect them. Then we applied this method to Debian 7.5 and a collection of 10,514 Java projects on GitHub and present the license inconsistency cases found in these systems. With a manual analysis, we summarized various reasons behind these license inconsistency cases, some of which imply potential license infringement and require attention from the developers. This analysis also exposes the difficulty to discover license infringements, highlighting the usefulness of finding and maintaining source code provenance.},

  abstract = {Open source software licenses determine, from a legal point of view, under which conditions software can be integrated and redistributed. The reason why developers of a project adopt (or change) a license may depend on various factors, e.g., the need for ensuring compatibility with certain third-party components, the perspective towards redistribution or commercialization of the software, or the need for protecting against somebody else’s commercial usage of the software. This paper reports a large empirical study aimed at quantitatively and qualitatively investigating when and why developers adopt or change software licenses. Specifically, we first identify license changes in 1,731,828 commits, representing the entire history of 16,221 Java projects hosted on GitHub. Then, to understand the rationale of license changes, we perform a qualitative analysis on 1,160 projects written in seven different programming languages, namely C, C++, C\#, Java, Javascript, Python, and Ruby—following an open coding approach inspired by grounded theory—on commit messages and issue tracker discussions concerning licensing topics, and whenever possible, try to build traceability links between discussions and changes. On one hand, our results highlight how, in different contexts, license adoption or changes can be triggered by various reasons. On the other hand, the results also highlight a lack of traceability of when and why licensing changes are made. This can be a major concern, because a change in the license of a system can negatively impact those that reuse it. In conclusion, results of the study trigger the need for better tool support in guiding developers in choosing/changing licenses and in keeping track of the rationale of license changes.},

While this literature recognizes the importance of managing boundaries in online communities, little empirical research has been conducted on actual gatekeeping tactics project members perform against outsiders’ contributions. Based on several years of engaged research with FLOSS projects, we characterize three gatekeeping tactics in FLOSS projects: non-response, social exclusion, and false acceptance. They all have hindered usability work. We also offer examples of usability specialists and their contributions succeeding in avoiding these gatekeeping tactics in FLOSS projects. This paper provides an important contribution to the boundary management literature through detailed examination of gatekeeping tactics in action, as well as to the Human Computer Interaction literature interested in contributing to FLOSS projects through usability work.},

However, newcomers face many barriers when making their first contribution, leading in many cases to dropouts. Due to the collaborative nature of community-based OSS projects, newcomers may be susceptible to social barriers, such as communication breakdowns and reception issues. In this article, we report a two-phase study aimed at better understanding social barriers faced by newcomers. In the first phase, we qualitatively analyzed the literature and data collected from practitioners to identify barriers that hinder newcomers’ first contribution. We designed a model composed of 58 barriers, including 13 social barriers. In the second phase, based on the barriers model, we developed FLOSScoach, a portal to support newcomers making their first contribution. We evaluated the portal in a diary-based study and found that the portal guided the newcomers and reduced the need for communication. Our results provide insights for communities that want to support newcomers and lay a foundation for building better onboarding tools. The contributions of this paper include identifying and gathering empirical evidence of social barriers faced by newcomers; understanding how social barriers can be reduced or avoided by using a portal that organizes proper information for newcomers (FLOSScoach); presenting guidelines for communities and newcomers on how to reduce or avoid social barriers; and identifying new streams of research.},

Therefore, in this paper, we suggested the design of an exploitable automatic verification system for secure open source software to address these issues. It is expected that, through the use of this system, the reliabilities of the open source software, the developers of the open source software, and the corporations using can be improved.},

Previously, executive level responses to computer security were disbelief and dismissal, while today the responses are questions of budget and risk. Computer security is a complicated issue with many moving parts and it is difficult to present a coherent view of its issues and problems. We believe that computer security issues have their root in programming languages and language runtime decisions. We argue that computer intrusion, malware, and network security issues all fundamentally arise from tradeoffs made in programming language design and the structure of the benign programs that are exploited. We present a case for addressing fundamental computer security problems at this root, by using advancements in programming language technology. We also present a case against relying on advancements in programming language technology, arguing that even when using the most sophisticated programming language technology available today, attacks are still possible, and that the current state of research is insufficient to guarantee security. We also discuss practical issues relating to the implementation of large-scale reforms in software development based on advancements in programming language technology.},

  isbn = {978-1-970001-27-3},
  abstract = {Agda is an advanced programming language based on Type Theory. Agda's type system is expressive enough to support full functional verification of programs, in two styles. In external verification, we write pure functional programs and then write proofs of properties about them. The proofs are separate external artifacts, typically using structural induction. In internal verification, we specify properties of programs through rich types for the programs themselves. This often necessitates including proofs inside code, to show the type checker that the specified properties hold. The power to prove properties of programs in these two styles is a profound addition to the practice of programming, giving programmers the power to guarantee the absence of bugs, and thus improve the quality of software more than previously possible. Verified Functional Programming in Agda is the first book to provide a systematic exposition of external and internal verification in Agda, suitable for undergraduate students of Computer Science. No familiarity with functional programming or computer-checked proofs is presupposed.  The book begins with an introduction to functional programming through familiar examples like booleans, natural numbers, and lists, and techniques for external verification. Internal verification is considered through the examples of vectors, binary search trees, and Braun trees. More advanced material on type-level computation, explicit reasoning about termination, and normalization by evaluation is also included. The book also includes a medium-sized case study on Huffman encoding and decoding.},

Even big software companies, well-known for being restrictive when it comes to publishing their source code artifacts, have recently adopted open source initiatives and released for general use the source code of some of their most notable products. We conducted an exploratory study on merits of the widespread belief that open-sourcing a proprietary software project will attract external developers, like casual contributors, and therefore improve software quality (e.g., “given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow”). By examining the pre- and post-migration software history of eight active, popular, non-trivial proprietary projects that became open source, we characterize the phenomenon and identify some challenges. Contrary to what many believe, we found that only a few projects experienced a growth in newcomers, contributions, and popularity; furthermore, this growth does not last long. The results from the study can be useful for helping software companies to better understand the hidden challenges of open-sourcing their software projects to attract external developers.},

Hence, firms need to consider potential opportunities and challenges upfront. This study explores how software firms interact with others in OSS ecosystems from a coopetition perspective. We performed a quantitative and qualitative analysis of three OSS projects. Finding shows that software firms emphasize the co-creation of common value and partly react to the potential competitiveness on OSS ecosystems. Six themes about coopetition were identified, including spanning gatekeepers, securing communication, open-core sourcing and filtering shared code. Our work contributes to software engineering research with a rich description of coopetition in OSS ecosystems. Moreover, we also come up with several implications for software firms in pursing a harmony participation in OSS ecosystems.},

In a society based on a federal structure and the principle of subsidiarity, it is almost natural to demand a vivid community with active citizens. Today, with the advent of social media and the new channels of communication, the question is how to leverage the benefits of this concept for local issues. More precise: How can the competence of the citizens be activated to make conditions of living in the neighbourhoods more attractive? In this paper, we discuss technical requirements for an open government. The SAGA standard of the Federal German Government strongly supports the notion of open-source software. With OpenSAGA, we introduce a new, performant and SAGA-compliant framework for the implementation of web applications for e-Government. Consequently, OpenSAGA is the platform for an OpenGovernment Suite, an extended prototype for affordable and interoperable open government solutions.},

Although other dimensions, like community health and activity, software governance principles or license permissiveness, are taken into account, there is no universally accepted OSS assessment model.

  abstract = {Complex software development projects rely on the contribution of teams of developers, who are required to collaborate and coordinate their efforts. The productivity of such development teams, i.e., how their size is related to the produced output, is an important consideration for project and schedule management as well as for cost estimation. The majority of studies in empirical software engineering suggest that - due to coordination overhead - teams of collaborating developers become less productive as they grow in size. This phenomenon is commonly paraphrased as Brooks’ law of software project management, which states that “adding manpower to a software project makes it later”. Outside software engineering, the non-additive scaling of productivity in teams is often referred to as the Ringelmann effect, which is studied extensively in social psychology and organizational theory. Conversely, a recent study suggested that in Open Source Software (OSS) projects, the productivity of developers increases as the team grows in size. Attributing it to collective synergetic effects, this surprising finding was linked to the Aristotelian quote that “the whole is more than the sum of its parts”. Using a data set of 58 OSS projects with more than 580,000 commits contributed by more than 30,000 developers, in this article we provide a large-scale analysis of the relation between size and productivity of software development teams. Our findings confirm the negative relation between team size and productivity previously suggested by empirical software engineering research, thus providing quantitative evidence for the presence of a strong Ringelmann effect. Using fine-grained data on the association between developers and source code files, we investigate possible explanations for the observed relations between team size and productivity. In particular, we take a network perspective on developer-code associations in software development teams and show that the magnitude of the decrease in productivity is likely to be related to the growth dynamics of co-editing networks which can be interpreted as a first-order approximation of coordination requirements.},

Altmetrics cannot be confined to traditional measurable indicators. That the importance of the open source software used, and its position in the online community is itself a strong measure for academic impact and success, which is all too often overlooked in research. The research can also conclude that the multiplexing of software online, through the citation of a citation, ultimately leads to an online peered review system within the community, effectively developing and maintaining through open use software itself.

  abstract = {The details of vulnerabilities are always kept confidential until fixed, which is an efficient way to avoid the exploitations and attacks. However, the Security Related Commits (SRCs), used to fix the vulnerabilities in open source software, usually lack proper protections. Most SRCs are released in code repositories such as Git, Github, Sourceforge, etc. earlier than the corresponding vulnerabilities published. These commits often previously disclose the vital information which can be used by the attackers to locate and exploit the vulnerable code. Therefore, we defined the pre-leaked SRC as the Pre-Patch problem and studied its hidden threats to the open source software. In this paper, we presented an Automatic Security Related Commits Detector (ASRCD) to rapidly identify the Pre-Patch problems from the numerous commits in code repositories by learning the features of SRCs. We implemented ASRCD and evaluated it with 78,218 real-world commits collected from Linux Kernel, OpenSSL, phpMyadmin and Mantisbt released between 2016 to 2017, which contain 227 confirmed SRCs. ASRCD successfully identified 206 SRCs from the 4 projects, including 140 known SRCs (recall rate: 61.7\% on average) and 66 new high-suspicious. In addition, 5 of the SRCs have been published after our prediction. The results show that: (1) the Pre-Patch is really a hidden threat to open source software; and (2) the proposed ASRCD is effective in identifying such SRCs. Finally, we recommended the identified SRCs should be fixed as soon as possible.},

How these skills are learned has received little research attention. This article presents a large-scale survey (5,309 valid responses) in which users and developers of the beta release of a popular file download application were asked which learning styles were used to acquire technical and social skills. We find that the extent to which a person acquired the relevant skills through informal methods tends to be higher if the person is a free/libre/open source code contributor, while being a professional software developer does not have this effect. Additionally, younger participants proved more likely to make use of formal methods of learning. These insights will help individuals, commercial companies, educational institutions, governments and open collaborative projects decide how they promote learning.},

There are different static analyzers available, and each of them usually works better in a small subset of problems, making it hard to choose a single tool. Combining the analysis of different tools solves this problem, but brings about other problems, namely the generated false positives and a large amount of unsorted alarms. This paper presents kiskadee, a system to support the usage of static analysis during software development by providing carefully ranked static analysis reports. First, it runs multiple static analyzers on the source code. Then, using a classification model, the potential bugs detected by the static analyzers are ranked based on their importance, with critical flaws ranked first, and potential false positives ranked last. Our experimental results show that, on average, when inspecting warnings ranked by kiskadee, one hits 5.2 times less false positives before each bug than when using a randomly sorted warning list.},

We then compare the rate at which software developers decided whether to accept or reject the new pastebin tools. We find that the overall rate of pastebin adoption follows the S-curve predicted by classic DoI theory. We then compare the individual pastebin services and their rates of adoption, as well as the reaction of different communities to the new tools and the various rationales for accepting or rejecting them.},

Nevertheless, there are very few empirical studies addressing release management in open source software development. It is already known that most open source software communities adopt either feature-based or time-based release strategies. Each of these has its advantages and disadvantages that are context-specific. Recent research reported that many prominent open source software projects have moved from feature-based to time-based releases. In this longitudinal case study, we narrate how OpenStack shifted towards a liberal six-month release cycle. If prior research discussed why projects should adopt time-based releases and how they can adopt such a strategy, we discuss how OpenStack adapted its software development processes, its organizational design and its tools toward a hybrid release management strategy — a strive for balancing the benefits and drawbacks of feature-based and time-based release strategies.},

Semi-structured in-depth interviews with 25 respondents that have performed RE activities in software development projects that integrate OSS components in 25 different software development companies in Spain, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. The study uncovers 15 observations regarding system requirements-OSS components matching and mismatch resolution practices used in industrial projects that integrate OSS components. The assessed projects focused mainly on pre-release stages of software applications that integrate OSS components in an opportunistic way. The results also provide details of a set of previously unexplored scenarios when solving system requirement–OSS component mismatches; and clarify some challenges and related problems. For instance, although licensing issues and the potential changes in OSS components by their corresponding communities and/or changes in system requirements have been greatly discussed in the RE literature as problems for OSS component integration, they did not appear to be relevant in our assessed projects. Instead, practitioners highlighted the problem of getting suitable OSS component documentation/information.},

Thus, the software source code and the associated data stored in the version control system, the bug tracking databases, the mailing lists, and the wikis allow us to evaluate quality in a transparent way. Even better, the large number of (often competing) open source projects makes it possible to contrast the quality of comparable systems serving the same domain. Furthermore, by combining historical source code snapshots with significant events, such as bug discoveries and fixes, we can further dig into the causes and effects of problems. Here we present motivating examples, tools, and techniques that can be used to evaluate the quality of open source (and by extension also proprietary) software.},

This study is a mixed-methods investigation of the socialization factors that influence contributor performance in large FOSS projects. A qualitative research component resulted into the development of a FOSS socialization framework as well as into the identification of key FOSS project citizenship behaviors. A conceptual model was then developed and empirically examined with 367 contributors from 12 large FOSS projects. The model hypothesizes the mediating effect of two proximal socialization variables, social identification and social integration, between FOSS newcomer socialization factors and contributor performance (conceptualized as task performance and community citizenship behaviors). The results demonstrate the influence of social identification and social integration in predicting contributor performance, as well as the importance of key socialization factors that are: task segregation, task purposefulness, interaction intensity, and supportiveness.

  abstract = {Context
Systematic mapping studies are used to structure a research area, while systematic reviews are focused on gathering and synthesizing evidence. The most recent guidelines for systematic mapping are from 2008. Since that time, many suggestions have been made of how to improve systematic literature reviews (SLRs). There is a need to evaluate how researchers conduct the process of systematic mapping and identify how the guidelines should be updated based on the lessons learned from the existing systematic maps and SLR guidelines.
Objective
To identify how the systematic mapping process is conducted (including search, study selection, analysis and presentation of data, etc.); to identify improvement potentials in conducting the systematic mapping process and updating the guidelines accordingly.
Method
We conducted a systematic mapping study of systematic maps, considering some practices of systematic review guidelines as well (in particular in relation to defining the search and to conduct a quality assessment).
Results
In a large number of studies multiple guidelines are used and combined, which leads to different ways in conducting mapping studies. The reason for combining guidelines was that they differed in the recommendations given.
Conclusion
The most frequently followed guidelines are not sufficient alone. Hence, there was a need to provide an update of how to conduct systematic mapping studies. New guidelines have been proposed consolidating existing findings.},

  abstract = {Context: Open source software (OSS) and software ecosystems (SECOs) are two consolidated research areas in software engineering. OSS influences the way organizations develop, acquire, use and commercialize software. SECOs have emerged as a paradigm to understand dynamics and heterogeneity in collaborative software development. For this reason, SECOs appear as a valid instrument to analyze OSS systems. However, there are few studies that blend both topics together. Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of the art in OSS ecosystems (OSSECOs) research, specifically: (a) what the most relevant definitions related to OSSECOs are; (b) what the particularities of this type of SECO are; and (c) how the knowledge about OSSECO is represented. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping following recommended practices. We applied automatic and manual searches on different sources and used a rigorous method to elicit the keywords from the research questions and selection criteria to retrieve the final papers. As a result, 82 papers were selected and evaluated. Threats to validity were identified and mitigated whenever possible. Results: The analysis allowed us to answer the research questions. Most notably, we did the following: (a) identified 64 terms related to the OSSECO and arranged them into a taxonomy; (b) built a genealogical tree to understand the genesis of the OSSECO term from related definitions; (c) analyzed the available definitions of SECO in the context of OSS; and (d) classified the existing modelling and analysis techniques of OSSECOs. Conclusion: As a summary of the systematic mapping, we conclude that existing research on several topics related to OSSECOs is still scarce (e.g., modelling and analysis techniques, quality models, standard definitions, etc.). This situation calls for further investigation efforts on how organizations and OSS communities actually understand OSSECOs.},

In this study, we develop a theoretical model and conduct an empirical analysis in a large online open source community. The results show that a developer's reputation level is determined by his or her 1) coding quality, 2) the deviation of the commitment behavior, 3) community experience, and 4) collaboration experience. In addition, we find that the group with an overall higher level of reputation would achieve a better performance, while the individual reputation level deviation within the group would impair its technical success.

  abstract = {Component based development was formerly dependent on propriety/closed source software’s (CSS) components. Open Source software components has attracted noteworthy attention and become an operational alternative of proprietary software because of OSS security, cost effectiveness, quality, flexibility and freedom. Due to the increased attention on component-based development in the past decades, companies have widely adopted open source software (OSS), with the view that using the right software is critical to project success. The availability of Internet as a marketplace for components and wide adoption of OSS has introduced new challenges for selection of software components. Source Forge, other general and domain specific software repositories, different software foundations and individual OSS providers offer an abundance of OSS components. Identification, evaluation and selection of best possible OSS Components for the required need is a quite challenging job. As a reaction to these challenges different methods have been proposed for OSS maturity measurements. E.g. Capgemini-Open Source Maturity Model(C-OSSM), Navicasoft-Open Source Maturity Model (N-OSSM), Qualification and Selection of Open Source (QSOS), Open Business Readiness Rating (Open BRR) and Easiest Open Source (E-OSS).In this paper we compare different Open Source software maturity models available in the market that will help user in OSS component selection.},

Firms choose research effort and whether to patent innovations or to use an Open Source license like the General Public License. We show that (i) patents generate a larger stationary reward but foreclose research within a sector, and that (ii) Open Source generates a smaller stationary reward but allows everyone to use the technology, and therefore, by attracting firms to the sector, it induces a faster pace of innovation. We characterize all the equilibria of the model and show that in equilibrium an Open Source sector appears only after a proprietary sector. We also find conditions under which the model has a unique equilibrium, in which a proprietary and an Open Source sector coexist and compete in the short run, but the Open Source sector dominates the industry in the long run. We use our model to study whether patents are inefficient, and to explain firms’ behavior in the software and the biomedical industry.},

It also examines the impact of system trust on adopters’ attitudes and intentions. The study draws upon a total of 192 questionnaires collected from enterprise IT and project managers. Our results show that trust factors have a positive effect on system trust. We also found system trust to be effective in increasing adopters’ attitudes and intentions.

  abstract = {Context: Better methods of evaluating process performance of OSS projects can benefit decision makers who consider adoption of OSS software in a company. This article studies the closure of issues (bugs and features) in GitHub projects, which is an important measure of OSS development process performance and quality of support that project users receive from the developer team. Objective: The goal of this article is a better understanding of the factors that affect issue closure rates in OSS projects. Methodology: The GHTorrent repository is used to select a large sample of mature, active OSS projects. Using survival analysis, we calculate short-term, and long-term issue closure rates. We formulate several hypotheses regarding the impact of OSS project and team characteristics, such as measures of work centralization, measures that reflect internal project workflows, and developer social networks measures on issue closure rates. Based on the proposed features and several control features, a model is built that can predict issue closure rate. The model allows to test our hypotheses. Results: We find that large teams that have many project members have lower issue closure rates than smaller teams. Similarly, increased work centralization increases issue closure rates. While desirable social network characteristics have a positive impact on the amount of commits in a project, they do not have significant influence on issue closure. Conclusion: Overall, findings from empirical analysis support the classic notion of Brook’s – the “surgical team” – in the context of OSS project development process performance on GitHub. The model of issue closure rates proposed in this article is a first step towards an improved understanding and prediction of this important measure of OSS development process performance.},

It has not been fully explored how following others influences the actions of GitHub users. Objective: this paper studies the motivation behind following (or not following) others and the influence of popular users on their followers. Method: a mixed methods research approach was used including a survey of 800 GitHub users to uncover the reasons for following on GitHub and a complementary quantitative analysis of the activity of GitHub users to examine influence. Our quantitative analysis studied 199 popular (most followed) users and their followers. Results: we found that popular users do influence their followers by guiding them to new projects. As a user’s popularity increases, so does their rate of influence, yet the same is not true for a popular user’s rate of contribution. Conclusions: these results indicate that a new type of leadership is emerging through GitHub’s following feature and popularity can be more important than contribution in influencing others. We discuss implications of popularity and influence and their impact on social structure and leadership on OSS projects.},

  abstract = {Chapter OverviewAll critical infrastructures are dependent on computer information infrastructures for management, control, and communications. The government defines a critical infrastructure as, …systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety… (DHS 2012). Critical information infrastructure (CII) facilities use special equipment to control or manage telecommunications, air transportation, the financial sector, the electric power grid and many other services important for the economy and daily activity. Cyber attacks against these and other critical infrastructure facilities can potentially disrupt services over widespread areas and long times. Critical infrastructure equipment systems have unique security vulnerabilities that can make them appear to be relatively easy targets for cyber espionage or cyber sabotage. Examples of cyber attacks aimed at CII facility equipment vulnerabilities include malicious computer programs called Flame and Stuxnet, which were reportedly created by the U.S. and Israel for cyber espionage and sabotage against critical nuclear industrial facilities in Iran. In the U.S., officials have expressed warnings that cyber attacks by nations, criminals, or extremists and terrorists could soon overtake traditional violent terrorist attacks as the top threat to U.S. National Security (Nakashima, Senate Ready to take up cybersecurity bill that critics say is too weak, 2012).This chapter explores emerging cyberterrorism threats to critical information infrastructures. There is discussion of the special cyber vulnerabilities found in industrial control systems that operate critical infrastructure facilities. These special vulnerabilities help make important critical infrastructures look like easy targets for possible cyberterrorist attacks. This is followed by a description of malicious zero-day exploits, which provide sophisticated stealth characteristics that can help to secretly insert malicious code into critical infrastructure systems for espionage and for cyber sabotage. Hackers and cyber experts may knowingly or unknowingly sell these zero-day exploits and malicious code to extremists or terrorist groups. Governments and businesses may also use the stealth features of zero-day exploit code to insert malicious cyber code into critical infrastructures of businesses or nations which may later be activated for cyber sabotage. As Western governments continue to use pre-emptive cyber strikes to enforce unilateral policy decisions, this may encourage retaliatory cyberattacks from extremists or terrorists that target critical infrastructures in the West. Analysis of the code for Flame and Stuxnet has been shared widely among teams of researchers and teams of hackers in several countries, and copies of the code have become an open repository for re-usable malicious technology. It is likely that extremists and terrorists may now also have access to copies of the malicious technologies available in this repository that can be used as models for future cyberterrorist attacks directed against critical infrastructures in Western nations.},

Aims: The objective of this paper is to present the results of a tertiary study conducted to collect and evaluate evidence to better understand similarities and differences between SLRs and SMs related to four aspects: research question, search string, search strategy and quality assessment. Method: We identiﬁed 170 secondary studies that were reviewed to answer a set of Research Questions (RQ) related to the practical conduction of secondary studies in SE. Results: Results show that both SLRs and SMs have generic RQs, broad search strings, and adopt automatic search as search strategy. However, quality assessment has been more widely adopted in SLRs. Conclusions: In practice, only the quality assessment is conducted differently in SLRs and SMs.},
