Feller  és Fitzgerald [feller_understanding_2001] szerint az OS jellegzetességei:
* It is parallel, rather than linear.
* It involves large communities of globally distributed
	developers.
* It utilises truly independent peer review.
* It provides prompt feedback to user and developer
	contributions.
* It includes the participation of highly talented, highly
	motivated developers.
* It includes increased levels of user involvement.
* It makes use of extremely rapid release schedules.
